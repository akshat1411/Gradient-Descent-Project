# Gradient-Descent-Project
Used the Gradient Descent algorithm to make predictions for Housing Prices and the Energy Output of a power plant. This was a part of Data Science and Machine Learning at Coding Ninjas. The salient feature of the project is that it uses Generic Gradient Descent Algorithm and not some function from the sklearn library.

Question 1 --> Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.
You are given a Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data. As studied in lecture, your task is to come up with Gradient Descent algorithm and thus predictions for the test dataset given.

Question 2 --> Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
