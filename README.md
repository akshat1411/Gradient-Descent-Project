# Gradient-Descent-Project
Used the Gradient Descent algorithm to make predictions for Housing Prices and the Energy Output of a power plant. This was a part of Data Science and Machine Learning at Coding Ninjas. The salient feature of the project is that it uses Generic Gradient Descent Algorithm and not some function from the sklearn library.
